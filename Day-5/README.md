### Static Behaviour Evaluation â€” CMOS Inverter Robustness â€” Power Supply Variation

Power supply scaling impacts the static behavior of CMOS inverters by shifting the switching threshold $V_m$, affecting noise margins and robustness.

SPICE simulations compare inverters at $V_{dd}=2.5V$ and scaled down to $V_{dd}=1V$, keeping transistor sizes constant with $W_p=0.9375\,Î¼m$ and $W_n=0.375\,Î¼m$.

- As $V_{dd}$ decreases, $V_m$ moves closer to the midpoint of the supply range; noise margins shrink.
- Lower $V_{dd}$ reduces noise immunity, making circuits more sensitive to noise and supply fluctuations.
- Reduced $V_{dd}$ lowers static and dynamic power but compromises noise robustness.
- Higher $V_{dd}$ improves noise margin but increases power consumption. 

This plot demonstrates the VTC shift and noise margin reduction as $V_{dd}$ scales down.

**Advantages of using $0.5V$ supply:**

- Approximately 50% improvement in gain.
- Around 90% reduction in energy consumption, highlighting efficiency improvements.

**Disadvantages:**

- Reduced drive strength causes slower switching and possible performance degradation.

### Gain Calculation from SPICE VTC Plot

To calculate gain from the inverter VTC:

1. Click on PMOS slope (left side of transition), terminal shows $x_0=V_{in}$ and $y_0=V_{out}$  
2. Click on NMOS slope (right side), terminal shows $x_1=V_{in}$ and $y_1=V_{out}$  

Gain is computed as:  
$Gain=\frac{y_0 - y_1}{x_0 - x_1}$

### Static Behaviour Evaluation â€” CMOS Inverter Robustness â€” Device Variation

#### Device Variation and CMOS Inverter Robustness

Device variation affects inverter robustness through:

- Etching Variation  
- Oxide Thickness Variation

***

#### Etching Variation

- Etching shapes physical transistor dimensions $W$ and $L$.
- Deviations may occur between **designed** and **actual** widths and lengths:
  - P-diffusion region defines PMOS gate width.
  - N-diffusion region defines NMOS gate width.
  - Poly-silicon thickness defines gate length related to technology node.
- Metal layers and contacts are also affected.

Etching variations cause changes in device current $I_d$ (which depends on $W$ and $L$), impacting:

- Switching threshold $V_m$
- Noise margins
- Overall robustness and performance

***

#### Oxide Thickness Variation

- Fabricated gate oxide thickness often varies from the design value.
- Since $I_d$ depends on oxide capacitance $C_{ox}$, oxide thickness variations affect device current and inverter performance.

Together, etching and oxide thickness variations significantly influence inverter robustness.

### Transistor Strength Definitions

- **Strong PMOS:** Wider width â†’ lower resistance â†’ stronger pull-up path charging output capacitor.  
- **Weak NMOS:** Narrower width â†’ higher resistance â†’ weaker pull-down.  
- **Weak PMOS:** Narrower width â†’ higher resistance.  
- **Strong NMOS:** Wider width â†’ lower resistance â†’ stronger pull-down path.

Larger PMOS width than NMOS width yields a stronger pull-up path, causing the output to remain high longer compared to NMOS pull-down curve.
